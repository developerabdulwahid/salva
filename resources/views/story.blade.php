          <h2>OUR STORY — TODAY</h2>
          <p>"Doner Kebab" is a fast food retailer that has created a healthy and nutritionally balanced approach to
            traditional kebabs.
            Our kebabs are made from quality ingredients that are exclusive to Doner Kebab Restaurants.</p>
          <p>We use lean succulent beef and pure chicken fillets. These meats are imported directly from Germany to
            maintain quality and consistency. We only use fresh, locally produced vegetables that are delivered and
            prepared daily along with our special "Doner Kebab" bread. These make the "Doner Kebab" a truly unique taste
            experience for our customers.</p>
          <p>Our tried and tested methods are totally different to the way other operators make their kebabs. The result
            is a nutritionally sound gourmet food experience that contains virtually no preservatives or additives and
            can be consumed day or night. With a strong modern brand and the promotion of healthy, fresh, nutritious
            ingredients that appeals to a broad market, "Doner Kebab" can only continue to grow and succeed. Maintaining
            the authenticity and originality of our kebabs is one of the main objectives of the business, and is the
            reason we continue to retain our market position at the top of the kebab industry.</p>
